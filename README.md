## Inspiration
We were inspired to do this based on our programming skills.

## What it does
A game that is a twist of Fruit Ninja. Instead of having fruit and bombs fly up, though, food and garbage fall from the sky, and you have two paws that swipe out from the left and right in order to eat food and avoid garbage. Score is based on weight gained from food eaten. After 3 times eating garbage, the game is over.

## How we built it
Implemented with Java and Android Studio in order to create screen layouts, developed with an open-source game engine 'andEngine', and used photoshop-created sprites and backgrounds in order to make the game much more aesthetic.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning and working with an undocumented API, wifi issues, and creating user-friendly front end.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Witnessing an idea come to fruition, designing and creating a roadmap that is reasonable for a weekend hackathon, and seeing the finished product come into reality is just amazing. It was amazing having time to enjoy the hackathon events, having completed a functional game through time management and impeccable productivity with the team.

## What we learned
I relearned working with Android Studio and learned to set up a game engine and created sprites that interacted with one another. I was able to apply my knowledge from my Object Oriented Programming class and my past internship in order to manage time and create a meaningful project.

## What's next for FatCat
Making it more smooth and have more features so it can be published in the Android app store.
